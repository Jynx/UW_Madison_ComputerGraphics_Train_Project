PROJECT DEMO HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6skysdedY&feature=youtu.be

This ia a project that I created using legacy OpenGL for a Computer Graphics class at UW Madison, fall 2014.

Our task was to create a basic train that was at least C1, that followed a track created via various forms of 
interpolating a set of control points. 

Techniques used:

- Cardinal Cubic interpolation w/ spline tension
- Linear interpolation w/ spline tension
- Arc length parameritization
